      <h1>A little bit about me!</h1>
        <p>I was born in Hawaii, but I moved up the the PNW area when I was really young. I play the French Horn and Mellophone(the marching French Horn) in for my school band. This year I am taking four AP classes(wish me luck!!). I am also planning on forming an Astronomy Club and a Coding Club at my school.</p>
        <p>I really want to learn C++ as well as refine my web development skills. I also want to learn French and Korean(if I'm ever given the time to do so!)</p>
